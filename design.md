# Design Document: Green Team – The 2025 Chronicles

## 1. Concept & Visual Direction
**Theme:** "Tech Sorcery & Future Foundations"
**Style:** Gothic Magical x Futuristic Clean.
**Core Metaphor:** The Green Team are "Wizards" who use "Spells" (Automation) and "Alchemy" (Architecture) to build the future.

### Visual Style Guide
- **Color Palette:**
  - **Void Black (`#0a0a0a`)**: Deep background to make elements pop.
  - **Neon Green (`#39ff14`)**: The primary accent color (representing "Green Team" and "Magic").
  - **Holographic Silver**: For text and professional finish.
  - **Gothic Purple/Obsidian**: Subtle gradients for depth.
- **Typography:**
  - *Headings:* A modern Gothic serif (e.g., *Cinzel* or *Playfair Display*) to evoke magic/history.
  - *Body:* A clean, monospace tech font (e.g., *JetBrains Mono* or *Inter*) to maintain professionalism and readability.
- **Interactive Elements:**
  - **Parallax Scroll:** Background runes/code snippets float at different speeds.
  - **Hover Effects:** Cards glow green; text "decrypts" on appear.
  - **Cursor:** A subtle glowing green orb or wand tip.
